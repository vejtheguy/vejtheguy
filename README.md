I'm an Information Technology student transitioning into Computer Science, with hands-on experience building modern web interfaces using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and SolidJS**. I enjoy creating clean, efficient UI components and bringing ideas to life through interactive user experiences.

I’m actively expanding my technical foundation while working toward a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm seeking **internship or part-time opportunities** where I can contribute to real projects, learn from experienced engineers, and continue improving as a developer.
